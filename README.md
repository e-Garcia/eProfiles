# eProfiles
Application that dynamically displays a set of profile information in an order controlled by a configuration obtained from a service.

Makes use of Hilt, LiveData, ViewModel, Repository, Kotlin, Coroutines, Compose, Retrofit, Glide and accompanist-pager.

This project library stack diverges from the standard Android since I wanted to try learning and using coroutines and compose together.

I have implemented other open source application architecture projects in my repository that use rxjava and data binding already, hence the change.
